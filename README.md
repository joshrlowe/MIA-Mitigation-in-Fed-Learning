## Run This Project

This project is designed to run in a Google Colab environment to leverage GPUs during training. To view this project, visit the associated [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19Kc1mIwP4wg_A8Z68-to10sPrkfF7OL_?usp=sharing).

The above Colab notebook is view only. If you want to run your own copy of this project, complete the following steps:

1. With the above Colab notebook open, go to File -> Save a copy in Drive.
2. Open your Google Drive, navigate to the saved copy, open it.
3. If subscribed to Colab Pro, go to Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> Select "T4 GPU". This speeds up training by using a GPU in the background.
4. Click "Run All" to run all of the cells.
